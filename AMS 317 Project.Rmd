# Read Data
```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
# Read dataset
data <- read_csv("/Users/hyl/Downloads/AB_NYC_2019.csv")

# Data Inspection
str(data)
head(data)
summary(data)
```

```{r}
# Check for NA
data <- data %>%
  filter(!is.na(reviews_per_month), !is.na(price), !is.na(room_type))

# Add a column to show host activity level: single-listing or multiple-listing hosts
data <- data %>%
  group_by(host_id) %>%
  mutate(host_activity = ifelse(n() == 1, "single", "multiple")) %>%
  ungroup()
```

# Data Cleaning 
```{r}
# Count rows where number_of_reviews is 0 and reviews_per_month is NA
count_na_reviews_per_month <- sum(is.na(data$reviews_per_month) & data$number_of_reviews == 0)

# Count total rows where number_of_reviews is 0
count_zero_reviews <- sum(data$number_of_reviews == 0)

# Check if all rows with number_of_reviews == 0 have reviews_per_month as NA
all_zero_reviews_are_na <- count_na_reviews_per_month == count_zero_reviews
all_zero_reviews_are_na

# Replace NA values in reviews_per_month with 0 where number_of_reviews is 0
data <- data %>%
  mutate(reviews_per_month = ifelse(is.na(reviews_per_month) & number_of_reviews == 0, 0, reviews_per_month))

# Question 1: Test the Influence of Room on Reviews Per Month
```{r}
anova_result <- aov(reviews_per_month ~ room_type, data = data)
summary(anova_result)
```
With this p-value: we reject the null hypothesis -> there is a significant difference in the reviews per month across different room types.
```{r}
# Boxplot for Room Type vs Reviews Per Month
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data, aes(x = room_type, y = reviews_per_month)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  labs(title = "Reviews Per Month by Room Type",
       x = "Room Type",
       y = "Reviews Per Month") +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Question 2: Test for Price Differences between Host Activity Level
```{r}

```
```{r}
